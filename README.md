## Introduction
Hello! I'm Ethan Hersch, a passionate developer with experience in various programming languages and tools. I enjoy solving complex problems and constantly learning new technologies. Below you'll find a bit more about my specialties.

## About Me
I have a strong background in software development and have worked on numerous projects in different domains (see below!). My background in mathematics drives me to find data-driven solutions to real-world problems. As a machine learning researcher at Cornell in Bayesian optimization, I seek these solutions.
